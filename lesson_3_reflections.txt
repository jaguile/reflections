When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  maybe you don't work only in one computer so you must have the repository centralized in a place that is always avalailable.
  Or maybe you don't work along, so your repository has to be available for other persons too.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because you have better control of the new changes that are produces in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	- fork: it's a clone from a GitHup repository onto another GitHup repository.
	- clone: A copy of a repository 
	- branch: it's a bifurcation in the same repository. You use a branch to star a modification from an original repository that you will apply on the original in the future.
