How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    Because if the typo is new, is just a difference respect the previous file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
    vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    pros
    - you can choose commits with logical meaning
    - commit are not so much bigger or smaller

    cons:
    - Maybe you want to return back to a concret point that doesn't involved a logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
    while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separatel
    Because Git is thought as a control version for code programs where a logical change can involve more than one file. On the other hand, Google Docs is not thought as a control version for code programs but for a documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 

    To view the history of all commits, you can use the log. In the other hand, if you want to view the differences of two commits, you use diff.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    BecaUSE you can turn back before the change very easily
